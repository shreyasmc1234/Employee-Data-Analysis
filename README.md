## Probelm Statement

The CEO of the organization seeks a real-time, data-driven understanding of the company's workforce. The existing employee data is stored in a raw format, making it challenging to extract actionable insights. The goal of this project is to analyze the employee distribution data and develop a Power BI dashboard that provides the CEO with critical insights into the workforcE.
  
## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to transform raw employee data into actionable insights through data analysis and visualization. The Power BI dashboard will offer a comprehensive view of various workforce metrics, including department distribution, gender distribution and demographic breakdowns.

- **Real-Time Insights:** The dashboard updates in real-time to provide the latest data on employee distribution.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Users can interact with various charts and graphs to explore the data from different perspectives.
- **Comprehensive Metrics:** The dashboard includes key metrics such as employee count, departmental distribution, and more.


## Tools and Technologies

- **MySQL Workbech:** For Data Cleaning and ETL.
- **Power BI:** For creating the interactive dashboard.
- **Excel/CSV:** Used for storing and preparing the raw data (Human Resources.CSV).

## Data Cleaning and Data Analysis using MySQL

Total number of records : 22214
   ```bash
   select count(*) from hr_details;
   +----------+
   | count(*) |
   +----------+
   |    22214 |
   +----------+
   ```
   Understanding the data :
   1. The Excel file consists almost 22214 records from the year 2000 to 2020.
   2. All the Columns having similar datatype that is text.
   3. First column name is misleading.
   4. Some records had negative ages and these were excluded during querying(967 records). Ages used were 18 years and above.
   5. Some termdates were far into the future and were not included in the analysis(1599 records). The only term dates used were those less than or equal to the current date.
      
1. Data Cleaning
    -- Renaming the Invalid character named column into "employee_id"
    ```bash
    ALTER TABLE hr_details RENAME COLUMN ï»¿id?!. TO employee_id;
    ```
    
    -- Changing the datatype of employee_id column
    ```bash
    ALTER TABLE hr_details MODIFY employee_id  varchar(20);
    ```

    -- Updating the date format of birthdate and hire_date columns because those are invalid formats
    ```bash
    update hr_details set birthdate = case
    when birthdate like '%-%' then date_format(str_to_date(birthdate,'%m-%d-%Y'),'%Y-%m-%d')
    when birthdate like '%/%' then date_format(str_to_date(birthdate,'%m/%d/%Y'),'%Y-%m-%d')
    else NULL
    end;

    update hr_details set hire_date = case
    when hire_date like '%-%' then date_format(str_to_date(hire_date,'%m-%d-%Y'),'%Y-%m-%d')
    when hire_date like '%/%' then date_format(str_to_date(hire_date,'%m/%d/%Y'),'%Y-%m-%d')
    else NULL
    end;
    ```

    -- Changing the datatype for those columns
   ```bash
    Alter table hr_details modify column hire_date date; 
    Alter table hr_details modify column birthdate date;
   ```

   -- Termdate is the column which contains invalid date and null values, Handling those invalid records.
   ```bash
   update hr_details set termdate=date(str_to_date(termdate,'%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s UTC')) where termdate is not null and termdate != ' ';
   ```
   
   -- Adding a new column named "age" to calculate the age.
   ```bash
   ALTER TABLE hr_details ADD age INT after last_name;
   ```

   -- Updating the values to the column age
   ```bash
   UPDATE hr_details SET
   age=timestampdiff(YEAR,birthdate,CURDATE());
   ```

2. Data Analysis
   -- Data is analysed and written set of select queries to understand the data.
   -- Queries that are used to analyze the data is available in [SQL Queries](https://github.com/shreyasmc1234/Employee-Data-Analysis/tree/main/SQL%20Queries)
   -- Extracted the produced report from select queries in .CSV format [Extracted Data](https://github.com/shreyasmc1234/Employee-Data-Analysis/tree/main/Extracted%20data%20from%20MySQL)
